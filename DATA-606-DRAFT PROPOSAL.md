# PROPAGANDA NEWS CLASSIFICATION USING DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES

## TEAM DESCRIPTION

This is a team project of Sonia Sonia and Seshadivya Batlanki.


## PROJECT OVERVIEW

* Propaganda spreads the ideology and beliefs of like-minded people, brainwashing their audiences, and sometimes leading to violence. 
* Due to common reach of internet to the people, it has become easy for many sources to manipulate people to believe in something which is toxic and unhealthy by the use of the propaganda.
* Propaganda news looks like the original news and it’s very difficult to identify as it is written very carefully. There are different ways through which we can identify it. Such as-
•	Having good knowledge over the topic
•	Focusing on words and topics where the stress is more.


## BACKGROUND

Though propaganda news classification is not a recent topic, but is an important one and in research for a long time. As the increase in social media use, there are many platforms and sources trying to populate their propaganda and feed to the people. The style of writing is also improving. So, there is a high scope of use of state-of-the-art model to identify the news and save many human minds to become toxic. There is a huge scope of improvement in this topic as there is very limited number of models and algorithms being implemented.


## RESEARCH QUESTIONS:


1.  Why it is required to detect propaganda based news?

2.	Which deep learning model can be used for efficient classification of propaganda based news?

3.	How to create web application that can handle large dataset with proper data structure format?

4.	Does contextual and linguistic features matter for such news classification?



## DATASET 

The dataset comprises data extracted from https://zenodo.org/record/3271522#.Yxg-FuxN2SV .This project aims to build an efficient web application for users which can classify the propaganda based news and articles from the actual ones.


## PRIMARY UNIT OF ANALYSIS

Propaganda based news detection and classification is one of the challenging task. 

(1) Because it is written for a particular purpose and particular group of people and 

(2)Because of similar use of context and linguistic features written for normal news as well. To solve these problems, this project aims to build an efficient web application where user can do a check whether the article, news is based on propaganda or not.


## FEATURE SELECTION:

1. Functional Requirements

* User should upload the data.
* User should be able to see the classified results.
* The proper user interface should be provided in web application.

2. Non - Functional Requirements

* Deep learning model for detection should be accurate.
* The application should be user friendly.


 ## METHODOLOGY:

* Selection of high-quality input data.
* Pre-processing, and creation of clean data.
* Implementation of contextual and other embeddings.
* Implementation of neural models using LSTM, attention, BERT, etc. models
* Validation of model using log loss and f1, precision, recall, auc_roc scores
* End to end pipeline creation for prediction of translated language at real time.

## MODEL SELECTION: 

* Prediction will be done considering the best performed model.
* Building a web application for the prediction of price of a used car based on the features and specifications of the car.



## OUTCOMES

* User friendly web application.
* Application should properly classify propaganda news from the trained domain of data.
* The deep learning model should be efficient and accurate

## TEAM RESPONSIBILITIES

### Sonia Sonia: 

* Data collection and dataset extraction.
* Initial Cleaning of the data.
* Exploratory Data Analysis.
* Performing Regression analysis.

### Seshadivya Batlanki:

* Data Modeling

* Model comparison and Cross validating the results
* Finding a best fit model for prediction
* Developing a web design for user friendly prediction

Along with our respective duties, we shall support one another's efforts to complete the project successfully. To advance the project and get around obstacles, we hold frequent discussions.
