  ### ABSTRACT:
  By offering a platform for the distribution of knowledge, social networking has taken over the entire planet. Most of the time, people pass along information without verifying its accuracy. Social media platforms are now utilized to influence decisions in a variety of areas, including politics, advertising, and more. It is hardly unexpected that misinformation is being circulated on social media as a means of swaying public opinion. One methodical and intentional strategy used to persuade people for political or religious ends is propaganda. In this study, machine learning and deep learning algorithms were used to attempt to distinguish between propaganda and non-propaganda text.
