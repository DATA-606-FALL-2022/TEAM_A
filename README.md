  ### ABSTRACT:
  By offering a platform for the distribution of knowledge, social networking has taken over the entire planet. Most of the time, people pass along information without verifying its accuracy. Social media platforms are now utilized to influence decisions in a variety of areas, including politics, advertising, and more. It is hardly unexpected that misinformation is being circulated on social media as a means of swaying public opinion. One methodical and intentional strategy used to persuade people for political or religious ends is propaganda. In this study, machine learning and deep learning algorithms were used to attempt to distinguish between propaganda and non-propaganda text.
### INTRODUCTION:
  Computer science is crucial in today's technological age for offering answers to practically all new sectors. Computer science has advanced dramatically since the 1970s, when the internet first appeared. It is now used in a variety of multidisciplinary fields, including remote sensing, technical diagnosis, traffic control systems, criminology, medical imaging, image processing, data mining, and automatic surveillance. The market is seeing a huge increase in the number of hardware and software products because of these applications. Today, data analytics is a key area of study for finding patterns in massive data sets. It integrates with several disciplines, including bioinformatics, natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and others. Important information is extracted from text, images, videos, and other sources during data mining. Data mining can perform both descriptive and predictive tasks. Descriptive tasks are used to characterize data, while predictive jobs use historical data to estimate the future. Some of the tasks involved in data mining include clustering, correlation, and pattern finding. Online social network analysis is a difficult procedure because of the massive utilization, variety, volume, validity, and real-time data that these networks generate. Online social networks (OSN) communicate using computer-mediated tools that facilitate the creation and dissemination of knowledge, ideas, business benefits, and novel communication techniques through online communities and links.
### Research Question:
  <li>Why it is required to detect propaganda based news?</li>
  <li>Which deep learning model can be used for efficient classification of propaganda based news?</li>
  <li>How to create web application that can handle large dataset with proper data structure format?</li>
  <li>Does contextual and linguistic features matter for such news classification?</li>
### DATASET:
The dataset comprises data extracted from https://zenodo.org/record/3271522#.Yxg-FuxN2SV .This project aims to build an efficient web based prototype for users which can classify the propaganda based news and articles from the actual ones.
